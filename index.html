            <h1>Hi, I'm Breanna!</h1>
            <p>I'm a junior at Westview High School who aspires to become a Computer Scientist with a focus on web and app development. To better pursue my interest, I have participated in several hackathons and app challenges, as well as taken many CS courses both inside and outside of school. With a passion for art, I hope to also emphasize on the UI/UX aspect of web/app development.</p>
